GIMX is a free software that allows to use a computer as a hub for your gaming devices. It works on Windows® and GNU/Linux platforms. It is compatible with Playstation® and Xbox® gaming consoles. The connection between the computer and the gaming console is performed using a USB adapter – [get one on the GIMX shop!](https://blog.gimx.fr/product/gimx-adapter/) – or a Bluetooth® dongle (PS3/PS4 only). The capabilities depend on the platform, the connection method, and the gaming platform.
